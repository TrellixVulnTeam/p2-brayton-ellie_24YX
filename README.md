I used W3Schools for the modal and accordion. I wanted a pop up to show x amount of seconds. This took a little playing around with, but was relatively easy using setTimeout.

The hardest after learning the basic building blocks of JS is learning all the different properties that you can use in the DOM. For example, I really didn't know that nextElementSibling existed. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_element_nextelementsibling. Admittedly, W3Schools made it significantly easy to understand. 

For the sake of this project, I just found a quote API to put on the Our Story page. I don't think I would do this in real life, since this site doesn't really call for it, but here it is:
